# Prototypal Inheritance
## What is Inheritance?
*Inheritance is when an object or a class is based on another object or a class (parent), using the same implementation and/or the same values.*

Ex.: class Animal{numberOfLegs, walk()} => class Dog {numberOfLegs, walk()}

*Technique for code reuse as well as logical entity structure*
